### Angular Localization
A simple implementation of localization in an Angular app. Simply switch between .json files holding translations, using a lang-switcher component.

### Considerations
- create interfaces for every language to provide type checking and autocomplete in code
- create a LanguageLoaderService allowing translation files from API's, databases and other external sources
